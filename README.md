# OpenAI Gym Car Race

An OpenAI Gym environment for simulating a self driving car on a race track. Built for [NYU SelfDrive](https://engineering.nyu.edu/research/vertically-integrated-projects/vip-teams/nyu-self-drive).

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you are using python3 and that all required python modules are installed by running the following:

`pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`

## Running

Run `python example.py` to execute the example project. Doing so will open a window inside which you can click on the purple blocks to create a track for the car to navigate through. After doing so, press the escape key to begin running the simulation. If you choose to run the simulation without rendering the car, you can omit `env.render()` from the main loop in your project.

This project is still under active development. [Bug reports](https://github.com/Taaseen-Ali/OpenAI-Gym-Car-Race/issues) are welcome.
